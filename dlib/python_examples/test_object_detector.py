# This example program shows how you can use dlib to make a HOG based object
# detector for things like faces, pedestrians, and any other semi-rigid
# object.  In particular, we go though the steps to train the kind of sliding
# window object detector first published by Dalal and Triggs in 2005 in the
# paper Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection.
#
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#   or
#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some
#   things run faster.  
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the
#   command:
#       sudo apt-get install cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires Numpy which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install numpy
